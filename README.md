# What is The Core Issue that the App Solves? 

In many transportation services, women and college students face safety concerns, affordability issues, and a lack of tailored options that cater to their specific needs and preferences. 

Existing rideshare apps often fail to properly address these challenges, leaving these demographics feeling vulnerable, financially burdened, or underserved. 

There is a pressing need for a rideshare app that prioritizes safety, affordability, and community connection to ensure that women and college students can travel with confidence, convenience, and peace of mind.
